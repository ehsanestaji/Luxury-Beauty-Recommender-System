Of all the hand creams, this is the best. It really moisturizes but doesn't leave your hands feeling greasy. And it lasts. I think a lot of lotions just have too much water in them. It has a very nice, subtle scent. I have to avoid a lot of lotions just because the scent is too strong!

The scent is kind of a spicy herb smell.  Not overly mild, but very pleasant and not overpowering in my opinion.  I'd rank it as milder than the average Bath & Body Works lotion.  I'd love an even milder scent for my husband, but he doesn't hate it, and actually prefers it to the off-putting scent of things like unscented Lubriderm (which still has a strong odor).

I'd had a tube of this about 15 or so years ago that lasted me for years and years, and thankfully this seems to be about the same product.  The formula is super thick and concentrated, and does not need to be applied quite as liberally as many other standard lotions.  Additionally, the formula doesn't cause as severe of pain when applied to skin that is literally splitting open from dryness.

I worked at The Body Shop, Sephora, and MAC. Never had I had a problem with dry/cracked hands; however, my mother did and my beloved almond Body Shop hand cream wasn't enough.

Someone told me to get this product, so I got the smallest size, just in case. Wish I had bought her this size, as this was now her go-to!

Skip forward over a decade, and I'm pregnant with my 1st and only child. I had the most difficult pregnancy, so I picked up sewing as a stress reliever (plus, I could make my son his own clothes and cloth diapers!) Little did I know that sewing DESTROYS your hands!

You cannot have a greasy hand cream while sewing, as it'll ruin your fabric. Also, you need fast access to your cream, and twist tops just don't do the job. Lastly, when your fingers, fingernails, cuticles crack and peel, it can snag your fabric and threads, destroying your garment.

I remembered this product and quickly bought the tube. THANK THE LORD I REMEMBERED THIS STUFF!!! Saved my life and fabric!

The pump is the best price--dollar per ounce--and the most convenient. The smell is great and the product is soaked up by my abused hands in seconds. Never have I ruined a good piece of silk, and rarely do my fingers snag fabric. The only time it does happen is when I forget to moisturize my hands.

My mom works in electronics and is the lead of production. She files papers all day and sometimes has to handle electronic components to help others. Her hands would crack and bleed from her work. It was painful to look at! Plus, she, too, cannot use greasy products, as that would ruin the electronics.

As she worked along with C&E Gardner's, her hands became normal once again, no longer embarrassing her. We love this stuff, and if it came by the gallon, we'd invest in tubs!",The BEST!!,1506643200,{'Size:': ' 250 g'},

I tried several hand creams to prevent my hands from cracking and becoming rough, including some of the lotions provided in my hospital, but nothing really worked. I am a male who enjoys a lot of time outdoors and I have to wash and sanitize my hands often for work, so my hands take a beating in northern winters.

I had been given a tube of this hand cream a few years ago while still in Florida, but decided to give it a try in Ohio. I am very glad I did!

So often hand creams and lotions are too perfume-y and not something most men would like to have to smell all day long. The scent of this hand cream is light, clean, and non-offensive or bothersome. It's not what I'd consider feminine, either...it's just right.

One does not need to use a lot, either, so even though the cream is a bit on the pricey side, a tube will last me an entire winter. It's a pretty rich consistency, so about a quarter to 3/8 of an inch of cream is more than plenty to rehydrate. It absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy.

You can bet I'll get another tube come next winter!",Non-greasy with a pleasant scent--great for male hands!,1487289600,,

Like, ""soft"" if soft had a scent. AND it has NEVER made my hands sticky. That right there is the major selling point for me along with how little you need to use. I am constantly washing my hands, so I have to moisturize a lot. I'm not always great about it, but when I do, a quick dime sized dab and good to go.

I seem to have become sensitive to whitening products, be it toothpaste or otherwise. They all either leave my gums raw, or cause tooth sensitivity. Not so with this toothpaste!
My teeth have become blinding white since using. My dentist even asked me what I was using because the difference was so drastic (as I had hoped it would be!).
I drink red wine, coffee, and I'm an ex-smoker. My teeth were getting a bit yellower as I neared 30 but they are finally white again and they are staying white!

The mint isn't too strong and doesn't make my eyes water either. Most toothpastes make my mouth feel like it's on fire, but this toothpaste does not.

My teeth look and feel great. This toothpaste gives my teeth that squeaky clean feeling and my dentist said my enamel doesn't look like it's taking a beating either which is a plus.

I couldn't recommend this toothpaste more. Skip the popular name brands and try this out. Yes, its more expensive, but a tube lasts me quite a long time and IT WORKS! The only downside is it can leave your toothbrush feeling hard after drying. This isn't too big of a deal for me personally, its just an annoying aspect. You also have to rinse with this toothpaste a bit. If you try it youll see why and what I mean. It leaves a milky white look behind even once you spit it out.

I went a period without repurchasing when I needed to because my husband wanted to try charcoal. It did nothing except cause gum pain. Over the course of this time my teeth started to dull but after reordering this and using it just once, my teeth were already whiter again. Its been a few weeks and my teeth are blinding white again.

I was on my second tube with no problems and ordered a third, when I was ready to use it, it was more than 30 days old.  Amazon normally does not help after 30 days, but in this case they did, but said it was the last time.  Consequently I tested it for a couple of days to be sure it would not split open then went back to finish my last tube.  Then I went back to the tube that tested, within a couple of days the bottom split open.  This tube seems to be a softer consistency which should help, but it does not, it still splits open.  The paste tends to harden and I end up wasting too much to make it worth it.  I did call the manufacturer and they said they could do nothing I had to go back to where I purchased the product.

I used two tubes to whiten my teeth and then I brushed with Super Smile twice a week or so, to maintain it. My teeth weren't blazing, TV white but they were a far bit whiter than they were. I also used the mouthwash intermittently. I had better results when I switch to a Sonic Care electric tooth brush too. Just an inexpensive model was fine.

They say veneers do not stain but the past few years I have noticed little brown lines on them and they aren't as white and shiny as they used to be.  I also quit smoking 3 months ago and have stains on the backs of my teeth near the gumline, where what's left of my real teeth are.  My dentist had told me to use Sensodyne and not to use any whitening toothpastes.  A few years ago, after a cleaning, I noticed that my veneers weren't as smooth as they used to be and food seemed to be sticking to them.  I can only guess that they must have used a polish that was too abrasive on them.  I was on the verge of buying an expensive tooth polishing machine but was nervous about the grit of the polish ruining my expensive teeth.  Suddenly, this toothpaste popped up in a search. I started using the toothpaste about a week ago and I already notice whitening of my veneers as well as all the little brown lines are gone.  After a few days use I smelled tobacco while I was brushing and, having smoked for forty years, I was used to that smell on my hands.  I suddenly realized I shouldn't be smelling that at all so I assume that was some of the stain coming off my teeth. I only purchased the toothpaste but I think I am going to buy a small tube of accelerator in order to completely remove the stains from the backs of my teeth.  Additionally, I had a couple of chewing teeth that food would get stuck in after every meal so I was constantly flossing there every time I ate.  Yesterday I noticed that is no longer happening.  I guess there was something sticky there causing all the food to get stuck.  One more thing to note - my teeth feel like I just had them polished all day and even when I wake up in the morning.  No more gross film in  my mouth so I assume no more morning breath!  If you are on the fence about getting this I suggest you take the jump.  You will not regret it!

Whitening strips had worked for years, but had stopped working, so I had spent the money for trays from the dentist and used these for a couple of weeks.  They would probably have worked (from the back side of the teeth according to my dentist) but I needed to stop due to sore gums.  So I was using the toothpaste and saw more change from it than from the trays and with no soreness (and I do not have tender gums at all) so stopped the trays and do not plan to use them.  Brushing in a circular motion for two mins morning and night is not a big deal and when I used it 3-4 times daily due to having forgotten to take my other toothpaste on a short trip, the extra brushings made a difference, too.  I am concerned about one reviewer's comment that the teeth re-discolor when one stops using the toothpaste, but will wait until something unavoidable happens to provide the test...meanwhile just continuing to brush at least twice daily and appreciate the fact that something does seem to work with minimal expense and trouble.....I do drink tea and coffee daily, but not red wine.....","Great even on ""old"" veneers...",1379721600,{'Flavor Name:': ' Original Mint'},

I have used this product off and on for several years. I find that with repeated usage it will lighten the teeth several shades, so it does work better than regular whitening toothpastes. For the best results though, one has to use this toothpaste in conjunction with bleaching, proper dietary habits, flossing, etc. for the overall whitest teeth. Even doing all the above, I have never gotten my teeth to the dazzling whiteness, as seen on TV. I guess for that one must go to veneers, sigh. This product has a nice cinnamon taste, and it is purportedly easier on ones tooth enamel than regular toothpaste. The downside is that it is expensive, and I don't think that it is the miracle product as portrayed on infomercials.

There is no chemical burn or bad taste and is excellent for veneers and sensitive gums.

As a frequent traveler to countries where the water may not be safe to drink without boiling, beverages such as coffee and tea (instead of just plain water) are the norm in my diet and I had unattractive stains on my teeth no matter how hard or how often I brushed with regular toothpaste.  I hate the chemical taste  and burn of chemical whitening toothpastes so my dentist recommended Supersmile toothpaste as a way to help with the stains between visits.

By using Supersmile's toothpaste with an electric toothbrush at night before bed, I was able to remove most of the stains on my teeth and get them as naturally white as possible.  I love how the Supersmile accelerant is in a separate tube so I can choose when I need to use it in combination with the toothpaste (to get the inbetween teeth stains) to get my teeth beyond natural white (but not optical white).

To get the most out of this toothpaste, it needs to be used without water on an electric toothbrush for the full recommended 2-mins.

I will comment, however, that the flavor is not quite the same kind of cinnamon found in cinnamon candies, nor will your breath smell as though you've been chewing on a cinnamon stick. The aroma itself is perplexing, but I know for a fact it's not cinnamon. I did not find it unpleasant (and in contrast, I find a low-key flavor more compatible with breakfast than something overpoweringly minty).

Flavor aside, the toothpaste on your dry toothbrush somewhat glides onto your teeth with normal application. After a few brush strokes, however, it does foam with your saliva.

It really works as advertised: It did not make my teeth feel sensitive. I can eat and drink cold items without feeling pangs in the same why other bleaching toothpastes have.

As for the whitening, it works to lighten maybe a few shades at the most. I noticed some improvement around 2 weeks after use, but I worry this may have been a placebo effect. By now (one month later), my teeth does look as though it got two shades lighter, and it also seems that this may be the limit to its lightening properties. I have considered that with my complexion (Asian), my teeth will not look as bright as if my skin was maybe more tan to produce a contrast. In addition, golden tones may accentuate yellow hues, even if they were not that noticeable on another person.

I have been using Supersmile for a little over a year now, brushing twice a day, flossing, and rinsing as well. Within the first month of use, I noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, and my mouth certainly felt clean; a year later, my teeth couldn't look any whiter without using professional whitening methods, but I still developed cavities.

I showed the toothpaste to my dentist and he told me he was actually impressed with how white my teeth became just from a toothpaste. After reading the bottle though, he cautioned me to find a better toothpaste to use intermittently, particularly, Arm & Hammer's Complete Care toothpaste. As I said, despite religious use of the product, I still have cavities, and I don't eat much sugar.

Supersmile does its job far better than many other whitening toothpastes. I haven't yet found a toothpaste that could get my teeth this white.

Being both busy and lazy, as well as eager to give both colognes equal treatment, I spent two weeks with my left half doused liberally in CK One, while I drenched my right half in Obsession for Men. Here are the results!

First, much less nausea than I expected. In fact, none nausea. They both pass test number one.

Next, my initial preference is immediately for CK One. Obsession smells like if baby powder grew up into man powder. It smells like a dentist's waiting room if it were also a Baptist church full of freshly showered senior citizens. Over the past two weeks, my right side got mostly ""meh""s from the men I hit on. The women I hit on with my right side were more receptive, but not my much. None of this is conclusive; I haven't tried hitting on anyone in a long time, so I'm out of practice.

I also found that Obsession for Men was far too easy to over-apply. I know I previously joked about dousing myself in the stuff, but in actuality I apply cologne by spritzing it in the air and walking through the cloud, so it's less potent than when you spray directly onto the skin.  Even with this approach, the smell was almost too strong. The smell lingers for days.

Although I preferred it, CK One still smells similar to Obsession. It's got that soft powder undertone, but it's much less pronounced in One than it is in Obsession. One is brighter, fresher, and a little fruitier. Not in a gay way (unless you're into that), but in the pineapple and papaya in the top notes. After looking up the notes for both fragrances, I think the baby powder odor must be coming from the musk and amber that both colognes have in their base notes. It makes sense that these two smell a little similar because they have many of the same components (Bergmot in the top notes, nutmeg in the heart notes, and the two aforementioned scents in the base notes).

Anyway, I preferred the CK One to Obsession, although both left the linger of powder hanging on me for days. Like that Shower-to-Shower talcum stuff my grandmother used to use all the time. A clean if not terribly sexy scent.",CK One VS Calvin Klein's Obsession for Men,1431561600,,

Among many included components, the citrus and green notes definitely create a crisp and fresh fragrance but the other prominent scents are floral -- lily-of-the-valley, jasmine and rose. This is where there may be a problem selling it to both genders.

Granted, so much of this is subjective  what we think smells good  so what may not work for one person is perfect for another, but for me, the florals are too noticeable. Neither gender residing in the household liked the fragrance  the male definitely would not even consider using the product and the female disliked the noticeable lily-of-the-valley floral.

The visual presentation is understated and classic -- frosted glass fashioned into a classic bottle shape with a brushed silver-toned metal top and sprayer packaged in a simple white box featuring an embossed impression of the bottle. The spray is released in a very fine mist and because it is Ea de Toilette the fragrance strength is light. After an hour a small spray on my arm had almost completely dissipated -- little scent remained.

To create this gender-free scent, ingredients typically used in male fragrances are combined with components typically used in female fragrances.

I loved the scent then and I still like it now. It is Unisex which means it can be used by Men as a cologne or by Women as a perfume. I tried it and so did my Husband. I personally liked it better on me. His cologne that he wears is a lot stronger and more masculine. The ck one fell a little flat in comparison. I do love it as a perfume though. It smells sweet on my skin and the violets, jasmine and Lilly scents really shine through.

The bottle that I received is 1.7oz. It is a decent size bottle that will last a long time...providing that you do not spill it. This comes to my one and only issue with this bottle. It has a screw on cap and no spray cap (like it shows in the picture). I am not sure if I received a box without the spray cap or if it just does not come with one. However, a spray top is necessary for me with fragrance. I have worn this 4-5 times already and I have already sloshed it all over my wrist once. Frankly, I am a klutz and this would be a pricey spill if I knocked the entire bottle over.

The 1.7oz is the most expensive size that you can buy (currently $28.82 per ounce). The 6.7oz bottle for the current price of $69 is a steal ($10.30 per ounce!). However, that is a lot of perfume. I would only recommend buying that size if you know that you or your gift recipient REALLY loves this perfume and will use it a lot. For me, this is an occasional perfume and the 1.7oz size will last me for years. The 1.7oz is big enough size wise to make a decent gift for a loved one. So, use your discretion and knowledge of the individual you are buying for when purchasing.

I read many reviews about this product being questionably authentic. I have purchased CK One many times in the past and this seems to be a legitimate. The packaging appears the same, the screw top cap and spritzer are the same. I think the reason people are questioning the longevity of this product is the duration of the odor. There are different strengths of colognes/perfumes you can buy. Sometimes designers give different options (at different price points). This product is an Eau de Toilette and not an Eau de Parfum. Eau de Toilette is only about 5 to 8 percent of the perfume essence, and is designed for shorter wear on the skin. While, Eau de Parfum typically contains anywhere from 8 to 15 percent of the essential fragrance and lasts longer on the skin.

Overall, I have always have been happy with this scent. I tend to use lots of different colognes in my collection depending on mood and occasion. I personally only use this as a casual scent and occasionally for parties. However, it could easily be a scent that works for any setting.

I'm a guy so if I ever smell this scent, even though it works as a unisex fragrance, I think of cologne, I don't think of perfume; and, more importantly, I get absorbed by the nostalgia of 1996, that entire era of my life, from the seasons to the clothes, to the people.

CK One has a safe versatility about it, in that it's great for winter, has a masculine charm about it like a spicy flame, but it's also light and not overpowering, not offenisve or dense, and is therefore great for summer as well. The citrus overtones mellow out to a nice aquatic freshness with only small hints of the floral. This, imo, gives the hue of the fragrance a bias that makes it very suitable for young males.

My bottle came as pictured and with a screw-off cap that you replace with the provided sprayer. At its price I wouldn't worry too much about counterfeits. The unit I got certainly smells authentic and projects all day.","Strong, safe, versatile scent",1393200000,,

There are so many things wrong with this straightener!
First of all... in the beginning it's okay BUT your hairs will get caught and pulled by the corners and sides of the flat iron. Second, when you use it and close the iron to straighten your hair it doesn't close flat plate against plate. It is uneven and badly made. And lastly, it breaks in literally after 5 uses.
It just starts to get looser and looser and eventually it snaps in half. The screws literally come out.

It was working great at first, then the hinge broke in between the two paddles (screw came out). I kept pushing it back in and it wouldn't stay, but kept using it anyway. Then the night of my nephews wedding I used it, and it must have been on it's last leg, because it died after i damaged the hell out of my hair. It singed my hair terribly before the wedding. So I decided to purchase another one since I figured it was a faulty iron. I purchased it last November. It has been working great until last night.

I have purchased over a dozen types of flat irons (including Chi, wet to dry, ceramic and tourmaline) over the years (gotta keep up with the trends!) and I always return to this one (and sell it in my salon). The wider bumpers mean you can't burn your scalp, which is a big plus for clients, unless they are very good with a flat iron. The wide size lets you put a gentle curve in your ends, which is hard to do with a thinner iron. I always use it at the highest temperature, which will not burn the hair (unlike the high temperatures on some other irons). The reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are:
1-There is some sort of coating on the plates, so you have to let the iron heat up for at least 30 minutes before you use it for the first time to burn off the coating and it's a little stinky.
2-If you drop it too many times, the case may crack and catch hair in the crack (not dangerous, but a little painful).
3-The wide bumpers won't let you get close enough to the scalp for very kinky hair, although you can overcome this by ironing the scalp hair in different direction - up, down, forwards and backwards.

I have a Hot Tools curling iron that I LOVE, so I figured this was a no brainer when my old flat iron kicked the bucket.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed.  It arrived from Amazon in the box - but the box was covered with a thick layer of dust, like it had been sitting on a shelf for 15 years.  I tried to ignore that trivial fact & continued to test out my new flat iron.  Here are my observations:

1) It is big & clunky.  I wanted a 1.5 or 2"" flat iron, so I wanted big - but because this is an older model, it is just too big & awkward to use.  It reminded me of my old crimper from 1989.

2)  It feels cheap & like it could fall apart very easily.  I don't know about you, but my flat iron is something that is often an unfortunate victim to being dropped on the bathroom floor.  I am not too sure this Hot Tools flat iron would make it.

3)  It must not be good for thinner hair.  I read almost every review on here & most of them are glowing reviews.  I noticed a trend that most of the good reviews mentioned they have thick hair.  So, in conclusion, I have figured out my unhappiness with it must have something to do with my not-thick hair.  It really just didn't work well.  My hair did not look nearly as smooth as expected.  In fact, it almost looked as if I didn't even use a flat iron.

4)  It made a peculiar buzzing sound when turned on.  I don't know if they all do that, or if I was just blessed with a special one.  But it sounded like it may just unexpectedly blow up.

I have been using this make and model of flat iron for the past 8 years and will never again buy another one.  I have purchased many other flat irons ... even the most expensive CHI irons and none straighten my hair as well as this one...in fact, my hair is so curly that the other irons are a complete waste of my time and money. No other flat iron has ever been able to really straighten my hair. IMO no other iron is worth even trying to use if you have VERY curly hair.

They don't last forever but they last for about 3 years...IF you take it traveling with you in addition to daily (or even more than daily) use.  If you use it less than daily and don't ""check it"" with your luggage on frequent airplane trips with you, you will get WAY more than 3 years of use out of this iron.  The plastic on mine EVENTUALLY breaks...where they are still completely usable but it pulls my hair a little (only after 3+years with HEAVY USE) so I just get a new one when that happens.  The price is AMAZING!!

My hair is extremely curly (cork screws) and comes to my bra hooks in length when it is straight.  I am committed to THIS flat iron and KMS Straightening Cream FOR LIFE!!! I wash my hair every other day (to keep it from drying out), blow it FULLY dry with a metal or ceramic brush...then use this iron...>> and my hair stays ""board straight"" through all 48 hours (unless I get sweaty or it gets wet...make sure you keep an umbrella around if you straighten your curly hair)!!

After drying my hair...it takes me less than 5 minutes to get all of my hair perfectly straight (with 8 years of practice...but fast even for new users).

I have moderate rosacea that sometimes becomes severely inflamed across my cheeks, nose, and above my nose. Some products would give me relief from symptoms for a week or so, and then stop working. I tried creams, natural and vitamin supplements, mineral creams, yoga, everything I remotely thought might help. This product is the only thing that has EVER worked, and it works quickly (drastically reduces redness within an hour usually- two hours at my worst inflammation), leaves no greasiness, and doesn't mess with my allergies. It is the most expensive beauty product I've ever bought, so it was risky, but I was desperate. I applied sparingly, maybe two or three times a week only to my cheeks, entire nose, and small area on forehead, and the jar lasted me one year exactly. I use fragrance/dye free generic moisturizer for my daily regimen, but this product is so effective I never needed to use it daily. If I could afford it, I would use it twice a day as my regular moisturizer. It leaves my skin smooth, velvety (instead of oily or dry) and free of the redness and bumps. It also dimished my acne outbreaks, which I think were associated with the rosacea, and the fine lines I was beginning to get due to the constant dryness. I love it so much that I told my dermatologist about it so that he could recommend it.

For a gal who cringes at $35 for Clinique moisturizer, that's a lot of dough. But this was by far the best money I ever spent on my skin! I have self-diagnosed mild rosacea and didn't want the usual treatment of oral antibiotics (which have their own set of problems for me). With just a few dabs of this product twice daily on my nose, cheeks and chin, I'm virtually redness-free, and my occasional blemishes are reduced by about half.

CC&C isn't miraculous. On infrequent occasions, I remain blotchy despite using it. This is usually when I've been under a lot of stress or have been sick. Extrapolating from that experience, I believe the greater the severity of the rosacea, the more limited CC&C's results will be.

CC&C doubles as a regular moisturizer, so - unless you have extremely dry skin - there's no need to use another moisturizer over it.

I ended up having to settle for using deodorants without an antispirant and applying baby powder with cornstarch as a crude way of controlling sweating. Then I found Total NonScents, which has a very low dose of an antiperspirant called Aluminum Zirconium Tetra Chlorohydrex Glycine that has been shown to be much more tolerable on sensitive skin than traditional mainstream chemicals. It has definitely worked for me in helping to control sweating so I can feel fresh throughout the day. My only two complaints is that it's unscented, I actually like the perfumed scent of most deodorants and miss being able to have those scents. And secondly, it's a wet roll-on. In order for this product to work properly it needs to be completely dry before you start getting dressed. If put clothes while it's still dry you are definitely going to be sweating by mid-day. So you need to either walk around shirtless for awhile to let your pits air dry or you can use a blowdryer to speed up the process. I know it sounds weird, but it really works if you are in a rush and can't wait 15 minutes to air dry.

I am absolutely *shocked* that a product that makes such brazen claims can be so ineffective.  The bottle actually has a cartoon CHICKEN on it, says it ""Effectively eliminates"" the bumps, and that ""Flawless"" skin is achievable.

  I have KP all over my legs; most of it is not inflamed, but there are a couple patches that are reddened.  I also have very fair skin (transparent, basically) and the KP looks bad enough that no one has seen my legs at all since I was 12.  (Insert complete social isolation and low self esteem HERE !)  So I was so happy to see that this ""KP Duty"" product was formulated specifically for this disease, and I really thought it would work.  Well, I've used it once a day for a month now and have noticed no reduction in the bumps or the red spots or the redness generally.  The skin does *feel* much softer, but it's as ugly as ever, and the bumps are obvious when you look at the skin in profile.

  I have no clue how long you're supposed to use this product before you see results.  They say you should try any new skin product for at least 6 weeks before you give up, so I think I will keep at it for a while longer.  But I'm assuming now that all of the raving reviews this product gets are due to its skin-softening effect, not ANY actual treatment of KP.  As Jay mentioned, any lotion can provide softer skin without the $35 price !!

  I have noticed within the past week or so that the ankle/calf region has started peeling.  I hope this is a good thing (exfoliation?) and maybe if it continues there could be some better skin revealed underneath.  However, so far even the peeling areas still have red, KP spots!

I love KP Duty because it works!! I suffered for years with red, splotchy, dry looking, pimply skin on the backs of both arms. I also noticed a much reduced version on the backs of my legs and bum especially during the winter months. I, as a retired nurse, was able to figure out that what I had was keratosis pilaris. I scoured the internet for a remedy way back in the early 2000's and happened upon ""KP Duty"" on Amazon, and IT WORKED!
I exfoliate in the shower, apply a thin layer to the affected areas and work it in well, then apply my regular lotion to the rest of my body.  I found it works well to apply the lotion directly after a hot shower. It is important to apply KP Duty PRIOR to applying any other lotion. To see progress with this product you must make a habit of using the product daily especially if you have a bad case as I did. With regular use you should begin to see a reduction in the affected areas  after about 2 or 3 weeks. To continue seeing results you must use the product daily; this is NOT a cure, however, it will reduce the symptoms as long as it is used regularly.

I've only just begun using it, but I'm so excited about it I wanted to leave a review with my first impressions. It is pricey. I want to keep up with the product - the price is iffy - , but if it works it will be worth the money! Also, the smell is very mild. Hardly even noticeable and goes away after 45 minutes or so. It smells like any unscented lotion really. Has a very mild chemical smell. So far the only problem I've encountered is that it is very thick and leaves my skin 'sticky' for hours. I've applied it at night and have woken up with it still feeling unpleasant, but it's bearable and once again hopefully worth it! Also, a little goes a LONG way.

Update 6/24/2015

I never updated this and I would love to share a few exciting treatments for treating KP that works heaps better than this lotion. I stopped using this lotion once I finished the tube. My skin became sensitive, raw, and my KP wasn't cured at all. Disappointed, I began my search again for other methods of curing my unsightly KP. I would say my skin bumps are severe. They occur frequently and are rather large making my upper arm skin red and dry. I experimented with dry brushing, which does help, but to truly eliminate my KP (which I found out as a complete surprise) was when I began using an organic, hand-made, coffee infused body OIL. I've completely stopped using lotion. The body oil I began using all over my body has helped to completely eliminate and heal the bumps on my thighs and arms. It's actually pretty mind blowing. If I stop using the body oil, yes give it three days and my bumps will be back, but when I'm consistent with it, they are GONE and my skin looks smooth and healthy.

This iron does a great job of creating the exact look I want that lasts throughout the day. The lever does not have a spring and is on the opposite side of most curling irons--this takes some getting used too, but is great once you get used to it. I love that you can set the temperature you want as well as release the handle to spin as you release the curl. The iron doesn't have an automatic off, which is AMAZING because you constantly get an even temperature which cuts down on curling time (you don't have to wait on it to reheat like most)and cuts down on ""frizzy curls.""

It's difficult to explain without seeing it, but while on a traditional spring iron, flipping the iron around doesn't matter, on a marcel, it requires you to hold the iron completely backward from how it's designed. There are a lot of other things that make a marcel tricky to use, but this means it's even harder to use on yourself than on someone else. So when people complain about the difficulty, they're not exaggerating. I was able to figure out how to use it reasonably well the first time I used it, but it took me at least a week of daily use to be fairly comfortable with it and another week before I was using it without thinking about it. I've been using it for months now, and for a while I thought it was a good iron, but I didn't really know if it was any better than your standard iron. That is until I forgot it while on a trip and had to borrow an old school iron from a friend. The difference is huge. First, a spring iron is actually a lot of work to use after getting used to a marcel. Second, the control and quality of curl with this iron is so much better. It's definitely worth the cost. If you don't curl your hair a lot or aren't comfortable with a normal iron, a marcel might not be worth it. But if you curl your hair regularly and have decent coordination and hand dexterity, this is a great iron.",but it took me at least a week of daily use to be fairly comfortable with it and another week before I was using ...,1497657600,{'Size:': ' Single'},

There's a bit of a learning curve if you're used to using a regular clip iron, but you get used to it quickly. I previously had the purple version, but the coating came off the barrel and was snagging my hair pretty quickly, and that was just me, not in a pro setting.

My other complaint, which they seem to have fixed, is the clip handle. The old version of all of the marcel irons did not have a cap on the end, which meant that, eventually, the washers that hold the cover on the metal handle would loosen and the cover would come off. There was no way to put the washers back on because they were held on by tabs and not threads. Hot Tools customer service is eh, I've had to contact them a few times about their warranty and it's iffy whether or not I receive a response (and when I do, they swear they've contacted me). They also wanted $5 and you pay shipping to them for a replacement, and really, I know these aren't expensive, but for ""professional"" quality, these should really last more than a couple of years, ESPECIALLY when being used at a professional level.

I have pretty thick (mostly straight) hair that is about at my collar bones... I had been trying to wrap my hair around a normal spring curling iron to get a soft wave but it just wasn't working... enter the Marcel Iron.  It takes a little getting used to, as everyone will tell you, but I honestly think it is easier than a clip and it must be better for your hair!

I don't do any fancy spinning. In case you're interested, this is my process:
- I divide my hair into three sections, bottom, middle, and top/crown because it's so thick
- I clamp at top of a piece of hair (that is so personal, I hate when people say to grab a ""one inch piece of hair""... you just have to experiment and do what works for you. Also, the size of the piece of hair totally changes the look)
- I spin once (either away from face or alternating away/towards for a messier look) to get the hair wrapped in a loop around the barrel
- Hold it for a second (since I'm looking for some volume near the root... a must when you have thick, heavy hair),
- Then I just drag the iron out (clicking the handle as I go down). I don't add any more spins or it makes it too curly
- Brush it out with fingers after hair is cool.

I get a million compliments and all my friends ask me to do theirs! FYI - this is what hair styles use (usually) and I can almost make my hair look the way my sytlist does = the ultimate goal!

2398,4,7,False,"03 16, 2008",A36MD7ZXWGJEWU,B00012C5RS,Ali B.,"First of all, let me say that this was actually a bad buy for me since I didn't realize that it had Retin-A in it (because of this, you really need to use an SPF in conjuction with this product) and Retin-A makes my face break out like someone hitting puberty. It's just not a good thing for me.

I'm Italian and I have the biggest pores all over and around the nose area.

Aside from the breakouts, I did notice a shrinking in the size of my pores. The most IMPORTANT thing to know about this product is that, in order to see results, you must use it TWICE A DAY, or you probably won't notice much, aside from the first time you use it.

The reason why I am in favor of this product, except for the horrible breakouts I had because of my freak-of-nature problem, is that my husband, who is not succeptable to breakouts, noticed an immediate differece in the tightning and size of his pores, as well as the smoothness in his skin.

This product really does work, just beware if you have any sensitivity to Retin-A, make sure you USE YOUR SUNSCREEN, and you really have to USE IT TWICE A DAY to see results. Make sure you go the full 8 weeks (I have no idea if one bottle lasts a full 8 weeks, so that's something you may want to find out)! I have heard that the product tends to pill when other things are applied on top of it. I didn't experience any of that, but it's something that you may want to be aware of.

Go to Sephora, ask for a sample, and see if you notice a difference the first time you use it. If you do, there's a good chance that it will work for you in the long run.",Hmmmmm. Just might be worth it.,1205625600,,

It shows the photos of the clinical trials and how the pores reduced in size. I bought it even though it was expensive and I'm very glad I did. Right away I saw a difference the first time I used it. I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and have to say that I can't believe the difference it has made. A bunch of the pores that were enlarged have closed completely, and the ones that were very big have gotten smaller. I'm also using 10% glycolic pads that exfoliates my skin and so I believe that is why my results have been so good. If you have blackheads it will take longer to close the pores because they have to be clear before they can actually close up. It does work very well at removing the blackheads, but if you have a severe blackhead problem your better off going at it with a 2-step approach with the glycolic acid before applying.

Not sure if this was a knock off (Im seeing others post comparison photos, and Ive never bought this brand before I did however go to Sallys and the bottle is different!) but this polish has destroyed my nails. They are peeling, brittle and just awful. Never have my nails received this amount of damage from any polish. Will never buy cosmetics through amazon again as there are too many fakes being sold, and too many fake reviews to back them up. Pretty sure this was right through amazon, not a third party seller.

Purchased dulce de leche for a wedding. I thought the color was pretty hideous, but the naipolish itself held up well. I took it to a salon and they gave me a manicure. If you're using base/top coats make sure you use Opi brand as others didn't work with it. Held up for the 3 days i needed it to, without any cracking or chipping. I doubt Ill ever use it again.

The product above and all the other OPI sparkly nail polish give terrific coverage with just two coats.  It is thick and sometimes I add a smidgeon of polish remover to make it less 'coarse' while preserving the fantastic color with a little more ease.

The shades of the polishes are brilliant,each stroke  just glides across your nail making your plain,dull nail into a work of art! I usually put two coats on and if I happen to have some OPI around I will add a top coat.
If you slip up and happen to acccidetly smear the polish off the nail onto your,not to worry Amazon has got the answer for that. If you are like me and others like me,who have illnesses like Parkinson's don't worry when your body shakes at odd times you will have a  messy finger. Well Amazon has the answer for that,look wher to chosee the OPI Polish is sold and there you will find a greenish clear Pen that will keep your nails or rather the skin around the nail looking good,I don't know what you call it but just go to the OPI section and there it will be!
Try it and be patient because at first it is a little awkward,but you must persevere, and then you will have your reward,your nails will look like Picasso worked his magic! OPI has several shades to choose and you might want to practice on those pretty Iight pearly shades first. Good luck,and be sure you grab the pen,and doing your own nails will save you big bucks!

3302,1,17,True,"09 7, 2017",A20KF54CSJ8WBC,B000142FVW,Shaina,"Last week, I purchased four OPI nai lacquers through this Amazon listing (Passion, Funny Bunny, Rosy Future, and Mimosas for Mr. and Mrs.). Amazon, not a third party seller, was the distributor of all four. Every single one was obviously counterfeit.

The text on all four of the bottles was applied crookedly and in uneven ink. The font and text on the front of three bottles is totally different from any font and text used on any OPI nail lacquer, current or past.  I still own well-cared-for OPI polishes I bought more than a decade ago, so I can compare easily!

Passion and Rosy Future look nothing like the bottles I've purchased from authorized sellers (salons and beauty supply stores). Seriously, Passion is not supposed to be a cool toned bubble gum pink that is thick in texture and opaque in two coats. Funny Bunny is a chalky, nearly opaque white (Alpine Snow, anyone?). Rosy Future and Mimosas do seem nearly normal in the bottle, but Mimosas is a nasty, sheer beige when applied, even after multiple coats - zero pink or peach.

Luckily, Amazon refunded all four in under eight hours after I explained the problems in detail. The ease and speed of the refund process makes me wonder if Amazon knowingly and willingly sells bogus cosmetics but prefers to settle with the consumer rather than encumber legal issues.

By the third you've got glittery, perfect, unique, shiny nails. However as a recommendation to everyone who buys any OPI shimmery nail polishes, if you apply it directly to your nail, later on removing the nail polish will take you forever, since it's hard to come off with the polish remover. So to avoid this tiny problem, I apply a coat of clear nail polish first, let it dry, and then continue by applying as many coats of the shimmer nail polish as I want (depending on the intensity that you'd like). The combination of the colors in this shimmer vary from reds, silvers, blues, turquoise, and some golds. I really recommend this product, and for the price....I recommend it even more!!!!

All the grays I've always purchased end up being either too blue or too white and streaky. Unfortunately, this was too blue. The picture was definitely misleading, since the nails look much more gray than mine did. Maybe with a slight undertone of blue, if even that. But, the color I received was definitely blue. Maybe, it was just my bottle? Looking at some of the other reviews though, I don't think so... Also, the application of it was a little streaky. I definitely needed to apply three coats.

Whenever I wear it, people ask what kind of blue polish I am wearing. The only gray I ever see is when the lighting is dark, and there is a ""pearl"" effect which gives it a bit of a gray shine. If you're looking for more of a light blue with a hint of gray undertone, this would be perfect. It has a nice pearly shine to it too.

Otherwise, I am still on the hunt for my perfect gray.",Color is misleading,1332460800,,

Wright,"After much deliberation and a lot of wine, I decided to go ahead and buy I Vant to Ne A-Lone Star and happily put it on my nails when it arrived. I was impressed with the color, an opaque light gray with a slight pearl to the finish, but it seems a little weaker than the solid gray that we see in the photos. I wore it for about three days before I decided I wanted something a little flashier.

As far as low-key colors go, it's good for work, play and about anything else. Survives dishwashing well, but the opacity of the color leaves a little bit to be desired. Unlike other OPI polishes, this is streaky on the first application and okay on the second...it requires a full three coats to not be able to see light through the tips of the nails.

Overall, the color is good. I like it better than a comparable polish (I think Recycle) by Essie, has no brown undertones, and is good for all skin tones. However, it made my long nails look short compared to other polishes. Where the moon of the nail meets the cuticle, the layers of color were pretty apparent and again seemed weak, and at the tips the polish wore off pretty quickly, even with a good topcoat. I think this is why the nails look shorter.","Classy Gray, only a little weak",1330992000,,

For a white nail polish it goes on so nice and smooth unlike Waltz and Marshmallow by Essie. I'm sorry, but Funny Bunny blows Waltz and Marshmallow out of the water. Those polishes are super streaky and tricky to apply. Application is a dream, no streaking, just easy all the way! It looks beautiful even in one coat, two coats are very pretty and sheer, but my preference is to do three coats. Some have compared this to Essie Marshmallow  but I don't  like Marshmallow for a number of reasons. I feel like the OPI FB is glossier for one, 100% less streaky, the marshmallow was a nightmare in the application would get my world's worst application award. I thought the Marshmallow was a bit more stark and white-outy on my hands.  Sorry Essie, but OPI won this one.

And it is also great to use as a base for colors that very sheer, some examples that I have used this with - ""I'm a Princess your not"", ""Princesses Rule"", ""Last Friday night"", ""Who needs a Prince"". This is a great staple in my polish collection

I won't stop, but the less time I have to spend on it, the better. I read the reviews on this and got the impression that it would last a while, which is exactly what I needed. The verdict is now in: from the time of my first 2-layer application to the first chip, this polish lasted a solid 10 days. From the time I first applied it to the time it was so chipped I needed to remove the rest and re-apply was 15 days. Even then, 5 nails were in near-perfect condition. That's respectable.

I can't make separate ratings for each color so I'll give my rundown here:

I love the color ""Do you Lilac It"" and I give it five stars for the perfect springtime lilac color and smooth application.
The ""Princesses Rule!"" color is almost a rose gold so it's pretty but it has more sparkles than I was expecting which creates a rougher finish than I wanted. 3 stars.
The ""AmazON...AmazOFF"" color is a beautiful foresty green color but it stains nails and skin like there's no tomorrow! Very difficult to remove even with acetone. I give it 3 stars for that.
""Strawberry Margarita"" is a perfectly fun bright pink. Five stars!
""I'm Not Really a Waitress"" is a deep red that's beautiful as long as you don't get it on your skin. Looks just like blood if you're a messy nail painter like I am. I give it a 4 star rating.",Varies by Color,1483488000,{'Color:': ' Princesses Rule!'},

This is a party on your nails and is a great color to go with almost any look.  I have another bottle from this line that I will review when I try it out, but I'm sure it will be just as sparkly and fabulous.
