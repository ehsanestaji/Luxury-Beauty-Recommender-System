## Introduction
This project aims to analyze Amazon product reviews using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to identify semantic relationships, the most common terms, and named entities within the reviews and use machine learning to predict the ratings.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- spaCy
- Gensim
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib or other visualization libraries

## Setup
Clone the repository and install the required packages.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-product-reviews-analysis.git
cd amazon-product-reviews-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Removing Punctuations**: Only whitespaces and alphanumeric characters are retained.
2. **Converting to Lower Case**: Uniformity across the text data.
3. **Removing Stop Words**: Enhancing performance by removing common words.
4. **Removing Extra Spaces**: Cleaning up the text.

### Advanced NLP Techniques
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down reviews into individual words.
- **Phrase Modeling**: Grouping frequently occurring words.

### Feature Engineering
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Count-based feature representation.
- **TF-IDF**: Importance-based feature representation.
- **Word2Vec**: Dense vector representation based on semantic meaning.

### Machine Learning
- **Dealing with NaNs**: Imputing NaN values for compatibility.
- **Handling Class Imbalance**: Underrepresentation vs. Overrepresentation.
- **Scoring Metrics**: Accuracy and F1 Score.

## Results
Use PCA and other techniques to visualize results and evaluate the model. 

## Limitations and Recommendations
- Cannot handle unknown words.
- Limited by lemmatization and lack of spell check.
- Cannot detect sarcasm or irony.
